Introducing the newest and most functional drainer on the market today - THOR



It supports seven most popular networks: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom and Optimism.

The search for assets on users' wallets is performed with the help of a reliable DeBank provider, and if desired, it can be replaced with Ankr, Zapper or OpenSea via settings. Drainer successfully manages to find the wallet's main coin, tokens and NFTs. The withdrawal is fully automated, but once a wallet was connected to the drainer, you can withdraw lifelong.





The logic of asset withdrawal: the most expensive assets are written off first, then the cheapest ones. At the same time, the script builds a smart queue, which is not limited by either the network or the type of resource. At the same time, the smart calculation system takes into account the resources needed to pay the network's commission, which allows you to squeeze everything possible out of the user's wallet, and send it to you. It is also possible to personally set priorities in the script, for example, to first write off tokens that support PERMIT, or those that can be withdrawn using exchangers.



There are several methods of token and NFT withdrawal available in the script, which can be easily customized for your purposes: tokens can be withdrawn by direct transfer, via confirmation, by calling PERMIT, by using exchangers, as well as by using an invisible signature. Depending on the wallet selected by the user, the most suitable method will be chosen. By default, the most inconspicuous and efficient one is chosen. As for NFT, the script is able to confirm the whole collection at once, i.e. for one signature you can withdraw everything.



The script supports a huge number of wallets, over 300 to be exact. There are two methods of connection: native and via WalletConnect. Native wallets work with the drainer directly, these include MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet. Other wallets you can connect through WalletConnect by scanning the QR code on the screen from your mobile device, or by opening the site from your phone and selecting a wallet from the list of those installed on your phone. Most mobile wallets support WalletConnect. Works with both versions of WalletConnect.
